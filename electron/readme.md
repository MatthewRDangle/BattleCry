# Electron Module
The electron module is the wrapper for the webapp for cross-platform support.

## Getting Started
Once the repository is downloaded run `npm install`. If there are errors installing
node modules verify you are using the correct version of NodeJS in the `package.json`.
Now build the webapp module, then run the electron npm script `npm run dev` to start 
the electron application. Every change to the webapp or electron application will require
the corresponding project to be rebuilt.
