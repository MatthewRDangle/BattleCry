# What is BattleCry?
BattleCry is a multiplayer sandbox game design for players who  wish add strategic depth to any of their existing 
strategy board games. 

The application offers a complete user interface for playing war-based scenarios. Command
your units and send them into to battle where the consequences of your decisions will 
be felt whether you or lose each battle. Be brave, be bold, and be victorious.

## How does it work?
The game requires users to create their own scenarios using BattleCry's definition api.
The API allows users to fully customize their scenario: units, terrains, maps, factions, 
and aesthetic. As a designer you just need to define the templates, assign them to the
tiles on a hex grid, and let the application handle the rest.

## How do I build scenarios?
To build a scenario see the [docs](docs/readme.md) located within the projects source code.
Start with the readme file. To build a scenario will require the use of JSON or YAML. Writing
these definitions is easy and examples will be provided for you. If the community likes this
project, and it becomes popular, and fans demand a user interface for the scenario api, I
will then create one. Otherwise, for now, it's JSON and YAML files.

## Pre-release Build Disclaimer
BattleCry is currently in alpha. Current releases are unstable and are not guaranteed to 
offer backwards compatibility for future changes. Only once a stable version 1.0.0 is 
released will backwards compatibility be accounted for.

## Legality
