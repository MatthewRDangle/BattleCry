# WebApp Module
The web application module is the rendering system for the browser. 
The views are constructed using [mithril.js](https://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js), 
styles are handled by [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss), 
and the project is bundled with [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).

## Getting Started
Once the repository is downloaded run `npm install`. If there are errors installing 
node modules verify you are using the correct version of NodeJS in the `package.json`.
Now run `npm run build` to bundle the project. The files with appear inside the `./dist` directory. 
Finally open the `index.html` file in the browser of your choice.
